	<description>Current Version: v2.0.0 (18th March 2020)\n\nUpdated to work with 1.1 and keep existing compatability with 1.0(untested at this time) - Please let me know if you spot any thing out of place with this.\n
Previous Version: v1.1.7 (29th July 2019)\n\nV.A.T.S for RimWorld! Allow your colonists, obedient animals and even some raiders to prioritize targeting certain body part groups of their enemies. Shoot those heads off in style!\n\n\n
